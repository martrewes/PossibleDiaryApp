# A Possible Diary Application for Windows (so far)
This is just an experiment to see if I can create an application that functions as a Diary. It is by no means fully featured.

When the application starts up, you must select the root folder of your diary. Once selected, you will now be able to add entries by selecting a date on the calendar. This will create a simple .txt file organised in a Root\\Year\\Month\\Day.txt hierarchy.
